1. if you have an older version of SFML, remove it using # sudo rm -rf /usr/include/SFML && sudo rm -f /usr/lib/libsfml*
2. go to the directory where you want copy the project and use git clone https://github.com/adn44/Stickman-project.git
3. copy the SFML-2.1/include/SFML directory in /usr/include
4. copy all the files in SFML-2.1/lib to /usr/lib, and all the files in SFML-2.1/lib/pkgconfig/ to /usr/lib/pkgconfig

The SFML-2.1/share gives you example of source code, and a local html documentation of the library
